# DKE Project 2
The second project at DKE regards the simulation of modular, reconfigurable robots capable of navigating complex, obstacle-laden environments and then assemble themselves into desired configurations.
The robots were simulated as "cubes" that could attach themselves to other cubes, and via locomotion move through an environment. Cubes could not move without being attached to at least one other cube, i.e. they could not "roll" themselves. They are also capable of climbing the obstacles, i.e. they can attach themselves to obstacles and disconnect as needed.

## Project Details
Pathfinding algorithms such as A*, MCTS, and pheromone-based swarm search techniques were used to guide the robots throughout the environment towards their goal. The realistic simulation of physical phenomena such as friction, gravity, and impulses is included. 

## Project Report
Please see the file "Project Report" for a detailed report regarding the simulation and our results.

## Grades
This project received a grade of 8.5/10, the highest in our class. This is the equivalent of a >4.0 (A+) on the American scale.
